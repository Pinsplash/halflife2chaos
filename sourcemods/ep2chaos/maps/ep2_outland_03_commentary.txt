		"synopsis" "The antlion web sacks, grubs, and workers show off a new illumination shader we developed especially for this level.  We began with concept art for the web sacks, modelled those, then added a material parameter that allows the model's self-illumination to be modified based on the angle at which the player views them.  The end result is an object that looks lit from within by a weird volumetric light."

We didn't want to make the Vortigaunt too powerful or he might take away from the player's fun; but we also wanted him to be a good ally to have around.  One solution, shown in this scene, was the shock attack where the Vortigaunt would stun a group of antlions, so that the player could finish them off."

		"synopsis" "The antlion experience in Half-Life 2 was characterized by a mindless, constant onslaught of bugs rushing your way.  We devised the antlion worker for Episode 2, as a way to add depth and variety to the underground sequences, by leveraging new types of gameplay.  Unlike normal antlions, the worker chooses to avoid direct confrontation, skulking in the background and lobbing acidic globs from a distance.  This extends the amount of time players spend with each creature.  By contrast, an encounter with an ordinary antlion is over in seconds.  The spitting behavior was derived from the bullsquid of Half-Life 1, but was updated to fit the more physical world of Half-Life 2.  To that end, the spit globs are not merely sprites, but physically simulated objects, flying through the air along realistic trajectories."

In playtest sessions, however, very few of our playtesters actually used it in this way.  The pit stayed in the room, but we changed the path to allow the player to descend into it and come back out."

		"synopsis" "Texturing of these caves provided a couple of significant challenges. We had never made such a large scale area completely out of displacements before. The convoluted topology of the surfaces made them especially hard to UV map without unpleasant-looking seams and texture warping. After some early attempts, we decided that we were not going to be able to map this area using conventional UV-mapping, so we decided to write custom shaders especially for the caves.  Our custom shader combines multiple axis-aligned projections based upon the surface normal.  This largely fixed our problems with stretching and seams.  Since we wanted to provide dramatic lighting in these areas, particularly when lit by the flashlight, we augmented the Source engine's radiosity bumpmapping with a new piece of technology.  This allows us to create a form of bumpmaps in which the bumpmapped surface details actually cast soft shadows across the surface. This emphasizes the surface bumpiness, especially when the light is at grazing angles."

To bring out his personality, the animators concentrated on shifting bodyweight and broad hand gestures.  Most importantly, where human characters tend to move their heads a lot for emphasis, we concentrated his performances on expressive spinal motions."

This made it far more likely the player would understand that he was dealing with a counterweight puzzle."

While we try to design such moments intentionally, sometimes the opportunities present themselves.  In this case, while setting up the gag where the rail car slides into the abyss, we opened a hole in the wall and discovered a view of the distant thumper.  It became clear that we could tailor the view across the giant cave to foreshadow the spot where Gordon would eventually end up."

[NOTE: good spot to take over the player's camera to swoop down and spawn antlions and trigger the vort's attack]"

However, most playtesters were fairly tired of antlion combat at this point, so we decided that a complete break from antlions would be an even better alternative to blowing up more of them with grenades."

Having too many obstacles made it hard to keep up the sense that recovering the nectar was an urgent task."
