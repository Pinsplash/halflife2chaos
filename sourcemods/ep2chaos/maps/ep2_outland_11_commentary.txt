		"synopsis" "In sketching out the scenes for the episode, we noticed a lack of interpersonal conflict between the characters who had survived from Half-Life 2.  Alyx, Eli and Dr. Kleiner have a lot of affection for one another, as you will see in many of the scenes.  And while we all value the benefit of strong positive relationships, we were happy to have Dr. Magnusson around to get irritated by all the hugging."

So to have someone that’s my type be in that kind of position is really amazing.  I think it’s a popular trend now, but that wasn’t always the case.  "

		"synopsis" "Due to the number of characters involved in this scene, and the cramped spaces, we found that the actors were constantly pushing the player around in order to get to their marks. We developed some tech that allowed the actors to gauge the position of the player and the other actors, and choose among a selection of marks. This not only solved the congestion problem, but made scenes feel more dynamic."

		"synopsis" "Dr. Magnusson was the result of a decision to bring forward another signature character from the original Half-Life, along the lines of Dr. Kleiner and Barney. As we developed the character, we kept referring back to this line from Half-Life to keep us on track:  Though we liked the character who came into focus, we found that this voice was sounding like too much of a caricature for our increasingly grim and realistic world. We like to hire actors with the natural voices that we want for our characters, as opposed to hiring actors to create voice characterizations. In John Aylward, we found someone who could deliver the brusque arrogance of the original lines, and also take the character forward into some of the richer and subtler opportunities we foresee for him."

Grounding the details of our world in reality, making them as precise as possible, makes the invented, fantastic elements seem that much more believable."

		"synopsis" "We intended White Forest to offer a change of pace from the constant action that preceded it'a few moments to reunite with old friends and get to know Dr. Magnusson, a breather before the big battle ahead.  However, our first version of the sequence was a log-jam of long, talky scenes.  Gordon and Alyx stood around listening to Kleiner and Magnusson argue at the top of the silo, then rode an elevator to the bottom of the shaft while Dr. Kleiner lectured them about rockets and satellites.  They wandered into a control room to watch Dr. Mossman's transmission, and then hatched a plan to get her back.  We knew we were in trouble when even the authors of the scene were bored, and no one had patience for the revelations that followed.  We divided the sequence into a number of smaller pieces that could be interleaved with solitary exploration and some combat.  This required rebuilding the path and moving the control room upstairs, where the transmission scene became a reward for surviving the secondary silo.  As a result of these changes, the White Forest experience is more varied, the narrative comes in digestible portions, and players are able to play at their own speed, rather than being led by the nose the entire time."

		"synopsis" "This steam jet is an example of something we call a 'mechanic refresher'.  It is meant to refresh the player's memory on how to perform a certain task they may not have used in a while.  In this case, we remind the player about using valves to turn off steam in a relaxed environment.  In the map just ahead, this trick will be fresh in their mind and they will be far more likely to realize they can use steamjets tactically when they encounter them in a combat situation."

Because of their bowed posture and semi-servile manner, this individual was dubbed Heep, after the Dickens character Uriah Heep.  In episode 2 we named the prominent vort at the white forest base Uriah.  In episode 3 we will find out Dicken's unused middle name for Uriah Heep."
