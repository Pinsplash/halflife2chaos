		"synopsis" "In order to train players that crouching through the trenches is critical for survival, we did several things.  First, we start the player in the safe position by forcing them to crouch under the fence to enter the area.  Once inside, they learn by watching the zombies.  Upright zombies are gunned down, but their torsos are free to roam in the shadow of the junk.  Some playtesters believed that while the guns were busy shooting zombies, they would be able to move freely; to counteract this impression, we increased the number of guns from one to three, making it clear that there was always going to be a gun free to shoot the player."

This garage was already in the game as a place where Alyx needed to stay while the player went alone through the autocannon area.  It was a perfect fit to have the mechanic rebels add the radar to the car while Gordon was busy somewhere else."

I want Alyx to be liked, I know everyone at Valve wants Alyx to be liked, but what is really great is that if I get off course or if I’ve been in the booth to long and I’m starting to sound a little naggy, then I have somebody who’s there to pull me back and say, ‘Hey why don’t you try it this way,’ or ‘I think you’re veering off course and starting to sound like somebody’s mother.’  Because I’m there to help, if you’re lost—you know, the ‘Get goings,’ or stuff like that.  To help keep the game moving and keep you on track.  There’s kind of a fine line.  You don’t want somebody constantly bothering you but you also want a friendly companion, somebody to help you out once in a while.  So trying to not go one way or the other was a bit of a trick for us."

		"synopsis" "Strong attention to visual design in this room make this unconventional puzzle both intuitive and rewarding.  To begin with the room is sparse, with the reward clearly visible, but locked up in the cage.  A strange centerpiece draws the player's attention, and the visible switch is obviously part of the solution.  The health charger next to the switch hints that the solution involves getting onto the catwalk rather than activating the switch from the ground.   The van entrance discourages players from bringing in objects they might use to solve the puzzle by stacking.  The lone grenade crate is a strong suggestion that grenades figure in the solution.  Finally, the corpse in the rafters and the scorch marks on the ground, and the story they tell provide the most important clue."

Because I mean if you think of the ideal super-self that you want to be, having bad-ass moves and being able to karate-chop everybody and then add onto that a writer to make you sound witty at every turn, it’s like having an uber-self for me.  So I immediately fell in love with Alyx."
