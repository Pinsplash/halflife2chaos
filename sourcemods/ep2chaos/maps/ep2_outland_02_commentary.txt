		"synopsis" "Griggs & Sheckley started off as minor characters who were just used to explain the setup for the turret battle.   Once done, they died fairly quickly, leaving players alone to fend off the antlion swarms.  We found this left players unsure of their defensive strategies and would force them to visually survey the cavern before setting up defenses.  So we made the two characters stronger and had them yell out their state to players and even suggest what openings the player should cover. This gave players extra time to setup a defensive strategy before the antlions arrived.  This also let us also rachet up the intensity level by slowly heightening their reactions to the threats.   Once we realized this worked, we decided to separate the characters and create an Abbott and Costello style team to do little bits during the down time the players were using to setup their defenses.  We ended up with entertaining character moments that also cued the player on game state and events."

		"synopsis" "Griggs and Sheckley's comment about not stepping on the grubs was originally intended for comedic effect and to suggest that, as usual, Gordon Freeman had brought trouble in his wake.  However, we found that some players took this comment too literally, and would spend the rest of the level avoiding grubs in fear of spawning more antlions.  We experimented for a short time with making this an actual mechanic, bringing in antlions whenever grubs were squished; but this had several negative results:  It made the tunnels far too difficult, and cancelled out any benefit the player got from squishing grubs for health.  We decided to keep the grub behavior simple and rewarding."

We needed a new visual way to instantly show that these new turrets also are allies, and decided to hark back to the aircraft nose art of WW2. The elaborate turret design also hints at how bored Griggs and Sheckley must have been sitting down here by themselves."

We addressed this confusion by changing the sequence of antlion waves so that the second attack came through the breach.  Players then understood that all four opening were vulnerable."

		"synopsis" "The turret battle design went through many changes. Early stages had the player controlling 3 turrets and not ever having to fight antlions directly.  After playtesters complained of not having anything to do during the battles, we changed the number of turrets to leave the player underhanded when in later rounds all the tunnels are active. This creates a better mix of resource management and combat. Later we added this tweaked version of the hopper mines to give players yet another tool for fighting the onslaught."

		"synopsis" "Every Half-Life game so far has started with Gordon Freeman weaponless.  Assuming some players had just played through Episode 1, while others might not have played it at all, we had to decide how long we should spend parcelling out new weapons and providing adequate time to play or practice with each one.  In this case, we decided to hand the player a number of weapons all at once, figuring most would have mastered their gunplay in previous episodes.  We held off doing a lot of deliberate training until we began introducing newer modes of combat later in the episode."

After a new model was created for the generator, we decided to exploit the vortigaunt's natural relationship with electricity by having him charge the generator much the way he charges Gordon's suit.  We were then able to use generators as 'vortigates' throughout the level to indicate areas the player could enter only with a vortigaunt's assistance."

Once we had decided exactly how much to explain, we had to come up with a way of revealing it.  Alyx's healing sequence offered the perfect way to pull Gordon out of mundane surroundings and put him in a realm where the G-Man can speak to him directly, but dialog is only one of our tools for narrative.  By blending images from the past, the present and the immediate future, we continue to stitch together the Half-Life story over time.  We make clear that the events at Black Mesa continue to resonate.  And we draw the strongest connections yet between Gordon, the G-Man, Alyx and Eli Vance."

		"synopsis" "We sometimes use sounds to set a mood rather than to literally underscore the onscreen action. The G-Man sequence, for example, relies heavily on the use of abstract and ambient sounds. We wanted the soundscape to have the deadened, internalized quality you get from putting your hands over your ears, so we started with recordings from inside a womb.  If you listen closely, you can hear internal gurgling noises as well as muffled heartbeats. We then added various other effects around the rythym of the heartbeat, plus long tailed reverb. None of the door or transition effects are literal interpretations, but are obscure metal and feedback sounds created to work in sync with the observable action. All of these things contribute to the scene's dreamlike quality."
