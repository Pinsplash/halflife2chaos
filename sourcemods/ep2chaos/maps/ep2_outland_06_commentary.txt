In Episode 1, we suppressed G-Man visitations completely to show that he had lost track of Gordon.  But after Alyx's healing incident, earlier in Episode 2, he is actively watching again.

		"synopsis" "In Episode One, Alyx climbs up into a hidden room and uses a Combine sniper rifle to assist the player.  The player never sees the rifle--only the targetting beam.  For Episode 2, we decided to show the Combine sniper rifle and let the player know exactly where Alyx would be standing when she used it.  However, making it visible and accessible to the player required us to come up with a way to make the rifle usable only with the vortigaunt's help.  Though it's somewhat of a contrived and arbitrary device for keeping the player from using the gun, we felt it was a worthwhile trade-off, given that playtesters tended to enjoy the co-op sequence of Alyx assisting them from above."

Having offered some brief training, we now build on the mechanic by having the player work with Alyx to create a cooperative fire trap.  Most players turn on the gas, at which point Alyx shoots a zombie on the stairs to create the wall of fire.  This triggers a parade of zombies to come out of the door below and walk into the fire."

In early prototypes, the bridge started off in its broken position--it was a static object the player had to navigate to retrieve the car.  When we incorporated the cinematic physics, we thought this bridge would be a great opportunity for players to see an immense piece of the environment transformed before their eyes.  The bridge collapse not only showcases the cinematic physics, it reminds players of the growing threat from the superportal, and sets up a navigational puzzle they must use the car to solve."

		"synopsis" "Having decided that we were going to rely on a car to get to White Forest, we had to figure out how to get Alyx into the vehicle.  Games often accomplish this by moving their characters close to the vehicle and then teleporting them inside in a very visible and jarring manner.  We knew this would ruin Alyx's believability as a character, so she had to smoothly get into a vehicle the way you would expect a person to in real life.  This was no small task given all the strange angles and positions the player could work the vehicle into.  Alyx also needed multiple entries into a vehicle, given that the doorway she wanted to use could be blocked or otherwise inaccessible.  This also provided interesting moments for Alyx where she could vault over the hood of the vehicle in a very heroic fashion.  The interaction between her and the vehicle was intriguing just by itself.  Once we were sure she could enter and exit the vehicle convincingly, we then had the task of making her believable as she sat next to you.  Our first experiments revolved around Alyx reacting to the physical nature of the vehicle.  When it crashed into a wall, she needed to be jolted.  When you went around a bend, she needed to lean with the momentum of the car.  These details were crucial in making her feel like she was really going along for the bumpy ride with you.  We also wanted her to be very aware of her surroundings and what the player was doing while in the vehicle.  If you ran over a zombie, she needed to echo the internal reward the player felt for accomplishing the feat.  If you were about to hit the wall, we wanted her to flinch and react to the impending collision much as the player at home would be doing.  There was a fine balance between making her too much of a backseat driver or having her be too quiet next to you. Ultimately, we wanted Alyx's presence in the vehicle to seem so natural that players would never consider it anything other than normal."
