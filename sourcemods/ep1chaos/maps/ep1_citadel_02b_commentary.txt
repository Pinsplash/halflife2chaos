		"synopsis" "This is where some player training pays off. After earlier training players on the use of ballsockets, they get a sort of 'live fire' test here starting the elevator. This is the beginning of this level's puzzle arc, where a basic gameplay mechanic is made increasingly more complex by layering other puzzle elements on it.  This first puzzle only requires that the player find a combine ball and put it in the socket."
