		"synopsis" "Welcome to Half-Life 2, Episode 1. We received a great deal of positive feedback on the commentary track in The Lost Coast, and so we've included the same feature in this episode. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your use key. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press the use key again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your use key again to stop the commentary. With episodic content, we are hoping to release games much more frequently than has been possible with the monolithic development schedules of the past. Game developers and game customers have been wanting to try this for years. Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play this, our latest installment in the ongoing adventures of Gordon Freeman. I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com. Thanks, and have fun!"

Our earlier versions of the intro sequence were heavy on graphic effects and relatively light on storytelling. When we showed those early versions to playtesters, they thought it was cool, but rarely had any idea what was supposed to be happening. We went through several iterations, each time simplifying the editing and tightening the effects. We eventually arrived at a good middle ground between the sort of psychedelic look we were shooting for and basic comprehension of what was actually taking place."

We also use this technology to create the illusion of vast spaces and distant horizons."

The Citadel will be erupting in a massive light show that took ten of us two months to orchestrate, and, if we're not careful, the player will end up facing the other direction staring at a tire. In this case, to establish that the Citadel is coming apart at the seams, we wanted the player to notice the debris falling off of it. We used a pretty straightforward method here - Alyx explicitly mentions the citadel while pointing at it. Like most of these solutions, it's not foolproof, but it has a high success rate."

As much as we hated to do it, the final solution was to have Alyx climb out while the player looks for an alternate route. We portray Alyx as more athletic and nimble than Gordon, so the player shouldn’t get too irritated by the fact that she can get to places they can't. Honestly, we're not especially happy with this crutch, but it's a trade-off we sometimes have to make so that we can get Alyx out of the way of interesting player challenges."

		"synopsis" "Right off the bat, we needed to hammer home some story points, reintroduce the cast of characters, and explain the player's immediate goal. It was a pretty intimidating chunk of non-interactive exposition. We generally approach these scenes by writing way too much, and then, through constant playtesting, trimming the scene to more manageable levels. In this case, even after some heroic pruning, the opening scene still felt too long. We ended up splitting the introductory sequence into three scenes, seperated by some gravity gun puzzle solving and then a dramatic walk across a crumbling ledge."

Given our realtime polygon and texture budgets, we chose fairly reserved or constrained performance over ever having the actors faces get into a bad looking or unnatural expression. For Episode 1, we wanted to extend the characters' facial systems to support more intense performances with a wider range of facial expressions, that would hold up better at close range. These facial improvements included increasing the detail around the eyes and mouth, increasing the number of facial shape targets – think of these as movements of muscle groups – by about 50%, rewriting the rules that control how these shapes blend, and increasing the intensity of many of our existing shapes. In addition, we added support for controlling the amplitude of the facial movement for lip-sync animation, which let us dampen or amplify the mouth shapes based on the volume or intensity of the dialogue."

By interweaving critical expository information - like how dangerous the Citadel has become - with some dramatic character interactions between Alyx, Eli, and Dr. Kleiner, we were able to convert a potential liability into one of the strongest scenes in the game. A great way to illustrate characters' relationships to each other is to have one of the characters in danger and show the others' reactions to it, which is what this scene is all about."

In this case, the obstacle is a crashed gunship that can only be moved out of the way by Dog. Though the final scene looks pretty straightforward, a lot of care had to be taken to make sure that Dog hit his marks and played his sequences without trampling and damaging the player."

		"synopsis" "Alyx travels through much of Episode 1 with the player and consequently passes through a wider variety of lighting conditions than she did in Half-Life 2.  This meant that we had to improve the quality of the lighting algorithms used on Alyx to look realistic in any situation, from the eerie hallways of the Citadel to the streets of City 17 at sunset.  For this episode, we added a specular lighting term to the shaders used on Alyx, which provides a realistic shiny look to her skin, her leather jacket and even her teeth.  In these new lighting calculations, we chose to specifically emphasize bright highlights caused by illumination from grazing angles.  This type of lighting, also referred to as 'rim lighting' is particularly dramatic when coming from low-angle light sources such as this bright sunset.  You’ll also note that the rim lighting is further enhanced by our high-dynamic range postprocessing, which causes the specular highlights to bloom in a striking and dramatic fashion.  We have found that the move to an episodic development cycle allows us to take advantage of the fast pace of graphics hardware innovation by incrementally adding new features, such as Alyx’s new lighting techniques, to the Source engine with each new episode."

In this particular case, she navigates this ledge with a combination of AI and scripted animations. We continue to evolve the systems of Half-Life 2 whereby characters move fluidly through dynamic AI and scripted navigation, but ultimately what matters most is how it looks to the player."

When the idea to have you and Alyx sit in a van and then have Dog toss it across the gorge was first suggested during a cabal meeting, everyone thought it was funny - and then we moved on to more serious solutions for the gorge crossing. As the design progressed, though, we kept coming back to the van idea, and eventually everyone agreed that we should give it a try. Even though the idea was kind of outrageous, it satisfied some key goals we had for the scene: Alyx and the player get across the impassable gorge and Dog is able to play a key role in the mission while also plausibly getting left behind. There were still some problems to solve, though: attaching animated models to the van was tricky, making sure the van didn't kill the player took some thought, and it took a number of tries before we were able to really illuminate Dog's thinking, as he went from testing his idea with chunks of debris to finally presenting the plan to Alyx. Ultimately, we were able to create a scene that solved some tricky game design issues, provided an intimate view of the relationship between Alyx and Dog, and delivered a surprising and visceral entrance to the Citadel."

In a happy accident, his head shook right after she asked him, 'You did do the math, right?' In playtests, players thought this was intentional and always laughed.  Because of that, we worked it into the animation and it ended up being a terrific little moment between Dog and Alyx."

Whether or not this created a sense of urgency is debatable. But after about three minutes of this, the one thing it definitely did was make the player hate Alyx. This was one of the observations that eventually led us to switch Alyx from generally leading players to almost always following. Through playtesting we discovered that players much preferred to set the pace themselves and that they especially disliked virtually any hint of bossiness from Alyx."
