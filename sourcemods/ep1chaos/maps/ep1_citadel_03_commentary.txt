		"synopsis" "The core design posed a lot of difficult challenges. Generally speaking, if the gameplay in a particular map isn't working, we can simply cut the entire area. That wasn't true of the core, because we knew it was critical to the story. On top of that, designing Citadel gameplay is often a bigger challenge than working out areas in City 17, largely because Citadel levels have a narrower set of gameplay tools; There are less enemy types available and the player is usually only armed with the gravity gun. Because of this, we had to go through many iterations of the core design. One of the early prototypes was a kind of futuristic version of 'Operation' where players had to use the gravity gun to cleanly manipulate rods into slots in the core. That didn't work partly because playtesters found that their view was obstructed by the rods, which made it frustratingly difficult to manipulate them with any kind of precision. We prototyped, playtested, and abandoned several other designs until we finally arrived at one that was fun while still being challenging enough to give players the sense that they'd accomplished a significant goal."

As a physical navigation puzzle, it's different from what the player has experienced before, and it's challenging while not being a binary succeed or fail situation.  There are a number of ways to approach this puzzle.  In addition to simply dodging, jumping and ducking the balls, the player can grab or deflect them with his gravity gun, or pick up the hatch and use it as a shield to block the incoming barrage."

The core became the primary light source in this space and in conjunction with the white set of Combine materials, we created an extreme contrast with the normally dark values of the Citadel metals."

Zigzagging through the space in three dimensions while navigating a variety of challenges let us present a few different visual and gameplay perspectives on the same space.  By letting the player see the core from a bunch of different angles, we were able to give them a real sense of its scale."
