whitelist
{
	// Example custom server whitelist.
	//
	// Do not modify this file.  Instead, rename this file to "pure_server_whitelist.txt" and then modify it as appropriate.
	//
	// sv_pure values are in order of "increasing pureness":
	//
	//   -1: No restrictions.  Allow clients to load any files.
	//    0: Only load pure_server_minimal.txt.
	//    1: Load pure_server_full.txt, followed by pure_server_whitelist.txt (the custom file).
	//       Also, in this mode, the server may specify additional public keys that it considers to be trusted.
	//    2: Load pure_server_full.txt only.
	//       In this mode, user only the public keys listed in trusted_keys_base are used.
	//
	// If multiple rules apply to the same file, then the rule listed later (or from the file loaded later) takes priority.
	// Therefore, because the custom whitelist file is loaded last, after a fully pure whitelist has been loaded, typically
	// the custom whitelist file is used to carve out exceptions (where the server wants to be more permissive), rather than
	// listing the files that are requested to be.
	//
	// 2 different rule types may be used:
	//
	//	trusted_source - require file to be loaded from a "trusted source".
	//                   A trusted source is a VPK that is signed with one of the public keys listed
	//                   in trusted_keys_base.txt or trusted_keys.txt.
	//	any - Client can use file from any source.
	//
	// For historical purposes, the following strings are also allowed:
	//
	//	allow_from_disk           - same as "any"
	//	from_steam                - same as "trusted_source"
	//  check_crc                 - same as "trusted_source"
	//  allow_from_disk+check_crc - same as "trusted_source"

	//
	// Three types of file specifications:
	//
	//	1. directory\*.*			- refers to all files under the directory
	//	2. directory\...			- refers to all files under the directory and all directories under that (recursively)
	//	3. directory\filename		- refers to a single file

	//
	// Allow custom player models.
	//	
	models\player\...           any
	materials\models\player\... any

	//
	// Allow custom spray decals.
	//
	materials\temp\...          any
	materials\vgui\logos\...    any
	materials\vgui\logos\ui\... any
	
	//
	// Allow "mymod" resources to come from disk.
	//
	materials\mymod\... any
	models\mymod\...    any
	sound\mymod\...     any
